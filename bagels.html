    <h2>Grandma's Homemade Bagles</h2>

    <p>Another family recipe hidden within. You are will love these homemade bagels how ever you choose to eat them!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Time to Cook!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First</strong> in a large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar and salt together, and add to the dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at a low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then, by hand, mix in enough flour to make a moderately stiff dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Second</strong> turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes). Cover, let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Third,</strong> cut into 12 portions, shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover, let rise 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> start a gallon of water boiling. Put 1 tablespoon of sugar in it, mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.</li>
        <li><strong>Next,</strong> the bagels are ready, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water, and cook 7 minutes, turning once. Drain them. Place on a greased baking sheet, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, eat hot or cold.</li>
        <li><strong>Lastly</strong> broiling option: For a glossier surface, place raised bagels on an ungreased baking sheet prior to boiling them. Broil them five inches from heat for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Then put them into the hot water to be boiled as above. Note: do not bake broiled bagels as long as non-broiled ones, 25 minutes should be long enough.</li>
    </ol>
